Landing-page

#This was a simple project from the Odin Project that was done to familiarize myself with Flex and Flexbox layout methods

It is a website written using only HTML and CSS. It only has four sections, namely:
 - The header section with the navigation bar, some text and an image.
 - The middle section with some pictures and words beneath the pictures.
 - The quote section with a mythical quote from Thor the God of Thunder.
 - Lastly, the footer section with the copyright icon and my name.

This was fun to make and it kind of pushed me sometimes when I was not really into building it. I love it.
